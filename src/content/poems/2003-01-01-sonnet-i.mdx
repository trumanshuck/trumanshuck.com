<Box mb={4} sx={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>
  <Text>The snow drifts down, wearily to the earth,</Text>
  <Text>and bitter winds blow, stealing life by touch,</Text>
  <Text>as I look for my home, my wondrous warm berth,</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>a train bound west, my belongings I clutch.</Text>

  <Text>But here in this place full, frozen and dead,</Text>
  <Text>I see life pass and continue forward,</Text>
  <Text>here lies true strength, in this cold winter's bed,</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>searching for hope, and moving there toward.</Text>

  <Text>Ever on, ever on, trudge these lives, tired,</Text>
  <Text>until they come to their rest in the dirt,</Text>
  <Text>in mortality, they're no longer mired,</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>floating in heaven, at peace and unhurt.</Text>

  <Text>I wish to be with them, though time is not right.</Text>
  <Text>So westward I go, from this: winter's night.</Text>
</Box>
