title: "We slept in the closet"
---

We slept in the closet\
on a queenspring;\
white walls sheltered cloud-\
stitched blankets and\
pillows with the shape of each of\
Christopher Robin’s friends.\
A map of the world crowded\
rest of the space; there was room\
enough for our bed\
but none for the boogeyman.

Outside lay gleamingblocks;\
our traps hidden in thick carpet\
and a huge wooden castle dad\
had built.  It’s walls higher than\
tiptoes and strong enough to\
keep even the dark things out.

And when the news came on\
or soft sleepyeyes settled over the house\
mom lead us back upstairs;\
our small feet scratchingmice on hardwood\
and we would shriek into bed\
using the last of our energy\
in jumbling the sheets.

She would smile\
foreheadkisses dream well\
but I preferred the grasp\
of cool, solid earlobe;\
It felt safe\
and fit in my tiny hands.

And when she left,\
though the moonlight threw shadows\
that hung watching through\
the door sliveredopen,\
my hand held the impression of\
a small pink shield and so\
the silvered light\
bounced straight from block\
to castle to dreams.
