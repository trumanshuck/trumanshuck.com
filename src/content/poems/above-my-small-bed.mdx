title: 'Above my small bed higher than I can quite'
---

Above my small bed higher than I can quite\
reach standing on a wobbling chair\
<in></in>tiptoes an unsteady dance of\
<in></in>stretching arms and air currents,\
<in></in>fingers grasping.

Haphazardly tacked across my ceiling\
lies a nest of tiny green-glowing stars\
<in></in>their light fit to illuminate only\
<in></in>themselves and any piece of\
<in></in>an idea projected\
<in></in>through them.

I remember once\
using the curled ropes of your hair\
to connected them together. You asked why\
and I told you the story of the star scorpion\
<in></in>whose barbed tail is made of the\
<in></in>hottest bits of sun fire and whose\
<in></in>eyes heavy silver neutron stars.

And once the last big light flickers and\
coughs dust across the night sky\
he will wave pincers, claws a net of gravity\
<in></in>catching the last meaty bits\
<in></in>of the universe, comets\
<in></in>crushed and then dissolved by\
<in></in>ancient poison.

But you did not quite follow as my hands\
traced a hundred shapes in the air,\
and that might have been best, since the\
false light had faded from the roof and from your\
eyes. I sighed and let the air escape skyward,\
<in></in>carrying bits of my dreams along\
<in></in>toward his exact jaws so that\
<in></in>one day my breath, too, would be\
<in></in>compacted and devoured.\
And eventually, from the quivering soup\
of the bits uneaten, a piece might start\
to spin and spin in the receding silence.
