title: "If I bend my neck back just enough"
---

If I bend my neck back just enough\
<in></in>each wrinkled crease a slithering earthquake of skin\
I can see where the tallest spruce\
begins to pierce the bottom edge of the sun\
<in></in>in just a moment its yolk will run out\
<in></in>and be absorbed by the softest bits of sky.

And I know I could chase the sunset,\
refuse to be pressed into that final chill of night\
<in></in>like a pen forced to black ink.\
I would start a slow jog\
bounding past withered lawns,\
doors shut against the rising dark.\
Past the end of day and my\
dog’s last, faint howl.\
But I know I couldn’t keep up\
<in></in>my legs are kindling burned too quickly.\
Before I’d have to turn and face\
the blade of each jagged shadow\
I might steal a car\
<in></in>adrenaline a tiny fire\
<in></in>in each quivering finger.

I would scream into the last rays of light,\
windshield catching the sun while\
it makes war with bugs and bits of earth.\
But even then my engine would cough and wheeze\
<in></in>there is no cheetah that can run so\
<in></in>fast, so long.

So I would have to hop on a jet\
and explode into the air.\
And there above the world\
I could stay suspended on bits of string\
hung from wispy clouds forever\
<in></in>sunlight woven to pieces\
<in></in>of morning and afternoon\
And I might even have used enough energy\
to trick myself into thinking I had lived.

But instead, oh\
instead I will stay on this porch swing\
and shiver just a little.\
I will count each star\
and I will connect them into a scorpion,\
a bear and a small silver ladybug.

Eventually my chin will fall\
and fuse with my chest, my eyelids will rattle shut.\
And these three will pull themselves from the night sky\
drifting down to dance just beneath my skin\
<in></in>their looping tracery a ward of heart\
<in></in>that I will take with me when I\
<in></in>visit the deeper parts of dusk.
