<Box sx={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}>
  <Text>I knew a girl who asked</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>in a voice as soft as the</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>lighter bits of evening</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>to make everything clear</Text>

  <Text>like before, sheâ€™d said</Text>
  <Text>when we were laying on</Text>
  <Text>beaten blades of grass</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>two entangled roots of</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>cloth and flesh and</Text>
  <Text>the only thing on her lips were</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>tinysounds and mine.</Text>

  <Text>It was much later then, and</Text>
  <Text>the moon had become only a dim lamp</Text>
  <Text>perched by her bed but</Text>
  <Text>I told her I would try</Text>
  <Text>so in a small castle made of silence</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>rocked by the crashing wave</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>of each passing car</Text>
  <Text mb={3}>I did.</Text>

  <Text>But when I woke next</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>just before the sun</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>might burn her form</Text>
  <Text pl={3}>into my true memory</Text>
  <Text>her bed held only the impression</Text>
  <Text>of a cold, hollow ghost</Text>
  <Text>and her clarity the spiderweb cracked</Text>
  <Text>windowglass letting in the morning chill.</Text>
</Box>
