title: 'I knew a girl who asked'
---

I knew a girl who asked\
<in></in>in a voice as soft as the\
<in></in>lighter bits of evening\
to make everything clear

like before, sheâ€™d said\
when we were laying on\
beaten blades of grass\
<in></in>two entangled roots of\
<in></in>cloth and flesh and\
the only thing on her lips were\
tinysounds and mine.

It was much later then, and\
the moon had become only a dim lamp\
perched by her bed but\
I told her I would try\
so in a small castle made of silence\
<in></in>rocked by the crashing wave\
<in></in>of each passing car\
I did.

But when I woke next\
<in></in>just before the sun\
<in></in>might burn her form\
<in></in>into my true memory\
her bed held only the impression\
of a cold, hollow ghost\
and her clarity the spiderweb cracked\
windowglass letting in the morning chill.
