title: "I walk a little more slowly toward the horizon"
---

I walk a little more slowly toward the horizon\
than I did before\
<in></in> (each step a question\
<in></in> answered by an echo)

I know the sea, still, but hear the waves'\
crash fuzzyfar away\
<in></in> (a bone china plate dropped\
<in></in> on the other side of the house)

And one leg drags the other, now, and my stride\
leaves a small trough in the sand\
And I see the world narrowed by high\
gray cliffs.

I remember leaving distinct craters, every forward\
push a burst of earth under a light more gold\
than red

The earth tumbling along before me\
The air ahead unoccupied\
Awaiting.

I can see each breath, now, and I wonder which\
misted ghost I've exhaled

But the surf still whispers endlessly ahead\
A gull sings sharply\
Beckoning.
