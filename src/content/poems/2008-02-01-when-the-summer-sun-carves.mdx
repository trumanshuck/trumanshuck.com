When the summer sun carves\
a boiling trough across my back,\
I think of reaching through heavy air\
and grasping a silver handle,\
letting water drawn\
from the deeplake grow\
cool across my index finger.

It seems, though, that it\
will never quite chill enough\
to fill completely whatever hole\
the concentrated sunlight bore through my flesh

even if it were to freeze down\
the spout, cracking arthriticfingers\
gripping my hand in ice\
<in></in>and even if that ice were\
<in></in>the deepest lumbering glacier\
<in></in>and I could suck each melting drop\
<in></in>directly from it

And just that attempt would cause my teeth\
to chatter and crack, a soft\
sprinkling rain of bonemeal.
