title: 'Sometimes I feel old; I can see'
---

Sometimes I feel old; I can see\
time collecting:\
<in></in>a fat water droplet bowing some\
<in></in>thick grass stem\
<in></in><in></in> its weight an imperfect circle back to the earth\
<in></in>holding on impossibly lo\
<in></in>ng before rolling regretfully off.\
years are splashed so roughly\
against concrete

and memory is spread so clearly,\
one fragile film absorbed with a glance\
<in></in>but the water is thin against the pavement\
<in></in>and black dust floats near the top\
<in></in><in></in> obscuring the speckles and liquid beneath\
now each old rainbow bounce\
suddenly lost

but another drop is building; anoth\
er drop will fall as dew\
condenses another\
drop
