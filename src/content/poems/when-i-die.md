title: "When I die"
---

When I die:\
<in></in>with a skin papyrus paper\
<in></in>and shakenbreath trembling\
<in></in>eyes like ocean fog\
well,

When I die I\
<in></in>doubt I’ll swim forever\
<in></in>in the highest clouds\
<in></in>propped up with an alabaster spyglass\
<in></in>and peeping grin of the curious\
no.

When I die I think\
<in></in>I’ll mix with the sea as ash\
<in></in>and get swallowed by a tiny silver fish to\
<in></in>ply the ocean’s undercurrent\
<in></in>my soul a small passenger\
<in></in>in one creature’s belly or\
another

And once I’ve learned all there is\
<in></in>about coral and tides and\
<in></in>the words to each whale’s song\
perhaps then I’ll flop back onto the sand and\
stretch my new muscles and\
wave again to the sun.
