title: 'Sometimes I feel old; I can see'
---

(the wind)\
And I don't care (causing bark to\
lashsnap whip the dark) much\
if I'm (and water to drown the sky and\
bugs&) your first or last or (the orchids\
make purpleblur as they) middleofnowhere\
(carve circles&squiggles like) because\
your hair (a toddler's sparkler) lays on my\
face just so and (but when the morning peeks in)\
I can see the small things in your (birds flute sweetly\
and grass sparklesalive) eyes and tinytrembles and know that\
(the flowers bow and dance with the sunlight) we exchanged bright-\
smiles by the downfeathers when (opening themselves to the beestouch)\
all we could see were softcurves&dips&bumps (disregard last night's\
shaking-twirling rainwater still dripping from stems)\
.

And tomorrow I may lie in a still bed\
(And dark clouds hang in the west)\
but this morning the flowerscent drifts\
through the open window
